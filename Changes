# Revision history for Perl extension BSD::stat.
$Revision: 1.34 $ $Date: 2012/10/23 03:36:24 $
! stat.xs t/utimes.t
  Addressed: BSD::stat support for OpenBSD  
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=80325

1.33 2012/08/21 10:06:12
! stat.pm
  * POD Fixes
! t/chflags.t
  skips where chflags() is not supported, like ZFS

1.32 2012/08/21 09:34:47
! stat.pm
  * added atimespec, mtimespec, and ctimespec
  * POD fixes

1.31 2012/08/19 15:46:15
! stat.pm README
  Document fixes

1.30 2012/08/19 15:36:31
! stat.pm stat.xs
+ t/utimes.t
  utimes() and lutimes() added
! Makefile.PL
  LICENSE => 'perl', # explicitly stated

1.21 2001.01.29
     ! stat.xs
       * newSVuv() that prevented perl prior to 5.6.0 from compiling
         was fixed.  For perl prior to 5.6.0 newSViv() is used
	 (That's how Perl's internal stat() behaves).
1.20 2001.01.26
     ! stat.xs
       * stat()->size returns negative value for files larger
       than 2**31 bytes.  Now fixed. (newSViv -> newSVnv)
       * following the changes above, types of other members
       was also changed to match CORE::stat (newSViv -> newSVuv)
1.11 2001.01.12
     ! backward compatible to 5.00503 (<miyagawa@edge.co.jp>);
       "use warnings" pragma is post-5.6.
       another side effect for starting module w/ h2xs which
       version is "too new." sigh...
1.10 2001.01.12
     + $st_* variable exported with :FILED tag.  BSD::stat is now
       fully upper-compatible with File::stat (but with performance
       penalty.  See pod for details)
     ! pod revised
1.00 2001.01.11
     ! t/filehandle.t	misteriously commented out #use FileHandle
			uncommented (<miyagawa@edge.co.jp>)
     ! pod revised
     ! version raised to 1.00
0.43 2001.01.10
     ! possible memory leaks fixed this time
     ! prototype added as l?stat(;$);
0.42 2001.01.08
     ! possible memory leaks fixed
     ! OP_STAT and OP_LSTAT is set when and only when the
       operation is successful
0.41 2001.01.08
     ! stat.xs is more compliant with perlxs guidelines
     ! further code optimization
0.40 2001.12.30
     BSD::stat is now as much like CORE::stat as a module can get!
     + now supports _ special filehandle
       (or stat cache now works).
     ! too much perlgut--wrenching?
     * so version is now 0.40, not just 0.31
0.30 2001.12.28
     BSD::stat is now more like CORE::stat
     + Now accepts filehandle as an argument
     + Now uses $_ when an argument is omitted
     + More performance gain
     - AUTOLOAD() no longer used.
     ! README is now more dist-safe
0.25 2001.12.19
     optimized: anystat()
     safer:     AUTOLOAD()
     added:	t/benchmark.pl
     changed:	test.pl -> t/*.t
0.24 2001.12.18
     fixed: lstat() and stat() behaved the same.
0.23 2001.12.17
     fixed: $scalar = lstat("nonexistent") wrongly got a reference
     which always evaluates true.  Now it returns undef when stat
     fails.
0.22 2001.12.17
     Debris in stat.pm removed; duplicate occurance of $VERSION
0.21 2001.12.17
     First preview release
0.01 2001.12.17
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-n BSD::stat -f
